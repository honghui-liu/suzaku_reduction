# A python script for data reduction of Suzaku

This is a simple script to reduce Suzaku data. Follow the instruction printed on screen and your can get you data reduced.

To use the script:

```
python reduction.py --pathin /path/of/the/input --pathout /path/of/the/output --id obsid --update --pileup
```

Parameters:
--pathin: **full path** in which the raw data is stored (e.g. /home/somebody/409049010)

--pathout: **full path** for the pipeline output. The directory will be removed if already exists

--id: the observation ID (e.g. 409049010)

--update: **optional**, if to correct the attitude file with tool `aeattcor2` (to take care of the 'thermal wobbling').

--pileup: **optional**, if to exclude the pile-up region (if exists).

Strategy:

* Run `aepipeline` to get cleaned event file.
* Update photon position with `aeattcor2` and `xiscoord` (if '--update' is specified).
* Estimate the pile-up region using `pileest` and save the region that will be excluded (if '--pileup' is specified).
* Get source and background region (manually) with `ds9`, the pileup region (if exists) will be excluded.
* Screen and filter cleaned event files of XIS and extract light curve, source spectra and background spectra using `xselect`.
* Creat RMF with `xisrmfgen`.
* Creat ARF with `xissimarfgen` with following settings (can be modified by editing 'response.py'):
  * source_mode=J2000
  * Source RA and DEC are obtained from key words "RA_OBJ" and "DEC_OBJ" from the header of event file.
  * limit_mode=NUM_PHOTON
  * num_photon=400000
* HXD PIN with `hxdpinxbpi`.
* HXD GSO with `hxdgsoxbpi`.
